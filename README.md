Monster Compiler is a short visual experiment that utilizes the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm to create tiny, unique, blue monsters. This project started thanks to @SunnyValleyStudio 's [Unity port for the WFC](https://github.com/SunnyValleyStudio/WaveFunctionCollapseUnityTilemapTutorial) and his very useful [Youtube tutorials](https://youtu.be/ws4r3wLPNSE?list=PLcRSafycjWFeKAS40OdIvhL7j-vsgE3eg). 

We decided to use this tool to create new outputs, particularly focused on the creation of **creepy, funny, modular creatures**. For this we designed our own tiles to use as an input Tilemap for the WFC in Unity.

<h4>Custom tiles</h4>

Once the tiles were designed, the input data was to be included. After several attempts, a final version of the input was settled on, one that could provide the variety for emergent new creatures to exist.

And then, the algorithm was run over and **over and over again!**

These are some of the creatures outputted by the WFC. These creepy looking meshes of eyes, arms and ears turned out to be a lot of fun.

<h4>Various outputs</h4>

<h4>Some possible uses for the MonsterCompiler made in Photoshop</h4>

We decided to apply some of the tilemaps we got for some real purposes in Photoshops. Using WFC to creatte patterns or textiles or print media seems like a great idea.

<h4>Foreword</h4>
  
Thank you again to [Sunny Valley Studio](https://github.com/SunnyValleyStudio) for the Unity Port and the tutorial. It was very helpful!
