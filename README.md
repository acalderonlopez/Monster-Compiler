Monster Compiler is a short visual experiment that utilizes the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm to create tiny, unique, blue monsters. This project started thanks to Sunny Valley Studio's [Unity port for the WFC](https://github.com/SunnyValleyStudio/WaveFunctionCollapseUnityTilemapTutorial) and his very useful [Youtube tutorials](https://youtu.be/ws4r3wLPNSE?list=PLcRSafycjWFeKAS40OdIvhL7j-vsgE3eg). 

We decided to use this tool to create new outputs, particularly focused on the creation of **creepy, funny, modular creatures**. For this we designed our own tiles to use as an input Tilemap for the WFC in Unity.

Once the tiles were designed, the input data was to be included. After several attempts, a final version of the input was settled on, one that could provide the variety for emergent new creatures to exist.
